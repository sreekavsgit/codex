# Codex Overview

## Distinguishing Features
- **Natural language interface**: interact via chat to generate or modify code.
- **Cross-file awareness**: paste multiple files for broader context.

- **Flexible workflows**: customize tasks and run commands with ease.

## Pros of Using Codex
- Excellent learning tool with thorough explanations.
- Handles multi-file prompts better than typical IDE autocompletion.
- Provides debugging assistance and code reasoning.

## Cons of Using Codex
- Not integrated directly into an IDE; no real-time inline coding.
- Requires manual copy/paste to move code between Codex and editor.
- Response speed depends on server and context size.

## Comparison to GitHub Copilot (VS Code)
- **Interface**: Codex is chat-based; Copilot integrates in the editor.
- **Real-time coding**: Copilot offers inline completions; Codex does not.
- **Context range**: Codex can reason over pasted files or descriptions; Copilot has a limited window.
- **Explanations**: Codex explains code and concepts; Copilot mainly completes code.

Use Codex when you need in-depth explanations or flexible, multi-step workflows. Use Copilot for quick inline suggestions within your IDE.
